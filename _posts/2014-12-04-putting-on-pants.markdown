I had a 9-5 job for nine years. To be honest it was more of a 7:30-5 job, but that's not the point. This changed eight month ago, when a friend and me founded a startup.
This moment changed my life dramatically. I was prepared for this, but I was not prepared for all the little things that changed and I did not expected these little things to have such a huge impact on my life and on my mindset.
This is the simple and honest story about the things no one warns you about and also the answer to the question what this has to do with pants.

Long before Georg persuaded me to found a startup with him, I was impressed by these brave little companies. I admired their courage to found a business from an idea without the fear of failing. It wasn't hard to persuade me to go this way as well.
Of course, I had some fears. Finacial fears, existential fears, and a lot of stupid fears. The stupid ones where all part of my fear to leave my comfort zone.

> If you fall, Iâ€™ll be there.
> - sincerely the ground.

In my old job I had some benefits of which I did not expect to call them benefits one day. I was externally controlled. This sounds really not that positive, but it is something you get used to. This simply means less responsibility and therefor a little less to worry about.
I can't be responsible for someone else's wrong decissions, right? 
Of course I tried to get involved as much as possible in my old job, but this wasn't always possible. I could tell my oppinion, but final decission where made by someone else.
Sometimes I got really angry about that. I felt like I wasn't heard enough, but there were also cases in which it was better that way, because my decission would have been wrong.
But it did not matter if I was wrong or right, because I was never the one who made the final decission. I was just an employee of other people who than made these decissions based on our input and a lot of other factors, which weren't always visible to me.
I knew that this would change, I was prepared for that and yes I was afraid. What I wasn't prepared for was what this is doing to me.

I have made countless decissions since we founded [xamoom](http://xamoom.com). Good ones, bad ones and a lot of decissions I'm still not sure about if they were right or wrong. Here's an example of a bad one and what it did to me. 
In this case I overestimated my own capabilities. This lead to two weeks of wasted time, desperation, sense of guilt, helplessness - 24 hours, seven days a week.
In the end I sat on the ground in front of a bar in a warm summer night, with a beer in my hand and told Georg about it. We found a solution for this and we were able to deliver the first version of our product as planned on september the 20th.
What I want to tell you with this is, that I was not prepared for the fact that everything got so personal. 
In my old job my day ended at 5pm and most of the time this was also the time when I stopped to think about work. Of course their were days when this wasn't the case, but now this is the case all the time.
I always think about xamoom, the things I have to do and the challenges I have to face. No matter what time or day it is. I need to thank my girlfriend a lot for staying with me, even when I'm searching for solutions, checking emails or fixing bugs in the evenings or on weekends, while sitting at home on our couch in the living room.

## lost in time and space
One of the most striking changes in my life is that my perception of time isn't the same anymore. I do a lot of things based on routines. Of course this is only true for trivial, but still important, tasks like getting ready in the morning. 
This morning routine for example is something I do without thinking about it at all, it is 100% automated. I guess I also look like a zombie while doing it. These routines help me to keep my mind free for more complex task and to stay focused.
The problem with routines is that you get used to them. I was used to my five days 9-5 job. I could (nearly) write my work-life-balance for the next year in my calendar.
Things like "bad mondays", "always waiting for friday" and thoughts like these suddenly disappeared.
I still have (nearly) normal times on which I am in the office, but work does not end anymore as soon as I go home to cook dinner for Martina. My mind is still working on the product, even while I am cooking and after that I usually answer to emails or work on concepts or the product itself.
This sounds like a bad thing, but the funny thing is that it doesn't feel bad. It became totally normal. Without even noticing the day of of the week, time and also how many days there are left until the next holyday aren't important anymore.

## getting things done
One of the biggest problems for me was beeing alone. We had no office for about six weeks, so we worked from home - I worked in Moosburg and Georg in Klagenfurt. I was alone from 7:15am, when Martina left, until she returned in the evening. I sat at the table in the living room with my notebook. No human contact for more than 9 hours everyday was something I wasn't prepared for.
I stopped wearing pants, because why should I, if no one is going to see me like this?
Working, taking a few breaks, coffee, a little snack at noon. I lost my joy on cooking. I felt like I never really woke up.
This had to stop. So I started to do my morning routine again, like I would really leave the house and so I also started to wear pants again. This helped a lot, but everything got normal again when we had our own office. A place I have to drive to everyday and where I have people to talk to. 
Another thing that got more important than before are tools to organize my day and ideas, which than become requirements, concepts and finally work packages and todos.
I also need a list of things I want to do today. This list usually comes out of the big lists, but it has to be small. Thousand things will never get done, but four things will be done today. Small lists for short time frames, that's my key of getting things done.

## controlled chaos
That's how I usually call what's happening inside our platform. Distributed cloud systems simply work differently than classic architectures and some things seem chaotic at first. The truth is they are simply different and as a developer I have to change the way I write software to fit these requirements.
But these words also describe the way I currently work. Concepts changing, long plans are nothing more than a rough direction. New ideas are constantly added to the product and old ones are removed. I try to keep our software stable in this chaotic project environment.
That's a big challenge. To make this work you have to keep an eye on the whole big thing all the time, but this also means that it is harder to get things done.
Welcome to the chaos between planning, design, development and requirements that change constantly.
If someone asks me what the biggest challenge is I have to face at the moment, I answer that it is to control this chaos and keep our product stable and clean.
But this chaos is also a good thing, if you know how to handle it. Just in an environment like this you are able to innovate and react fast to changing requirements and customer needs. Big companies aren't able to do this, because of the fact that they are big and have to plan a lot differently than we do. So this big challenge seems to be one of our biggest assests.

Now I have told you a lot about my experiences of being part of a startup and I guess you should do more important things now, but I'm also curious about your experiences.
Have you been in such a life changing situation before? How did this affect you?
