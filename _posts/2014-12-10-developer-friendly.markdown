Developer relations become more important than ever for nearly every company that produces software. So let's imagine you are a company that produces software or even a service or a platform. This is your product. And now imagine you do not care enough about third party developers. In this case you are going to have a really bad time, here's why.

## Developers need your attention
Standalone software that does not need to be integrated into existing systems and workflows isn't very common anymore. No one wants little isolated islands. Everything has to interact, because you do not want to enter the same data into more than one system and every system has its own strength and purpose, so you need more than just one product to fulfill your needs.
This means nearly every application or service has to have some kind of interface to allow other applications to interact with it.

## Interfaces, APIs, customizing and so on...
Of course you can't tell how every possible system landscape of every potential future customer will look like, but the good news is that you do not have to. For a very long time applications offer so called APIs, which allow other developers to interact and integrate it into their applications.

## Bad APIs
The sad thing is that these interfaces and APIs are often the worst part of an application. It seems like companies think they are less important than the rest of the product and so they invest less money, and that means time, in designing and building these parts of their software.
The result is that a lot of APIs either do not offer all the functionalities to effectifly use them or they are designed to be practically unusable.
But there is also another thing that happens from time to time. Some interfaces are implemented using properiterian technologies instead of open and established standards. This case is the one I really don't understand, because you know what that means, don't you? It means that you lock out a lot of developers who want to use your product! You lock out customers! This can't be a strategy for any company who wants to make money with their product.

## Relations
Another thing companies tend to ignore is documentation. No matter how good your API is, you need to offer as much documentation and code samples as possible for third party developers. You also have to keep these documents up to date, searchable and easy to access for everybody arround the world. 
Let's be honest there is someone that wants to use your product and integrate it or build something great on top of it. This is a customer, but if you make it hard for him to understand your product, he will simply look for another solution. In most cases there are alternative products. You are not a wonderful unique snowflake.

## a few more tipps
You want your product to be successful and you want to a lot of customers? Than you have to make it as easy as possible for third party developers to test and evaluate it. Offer free demo systems, which developers can use to play with it. Make them available without signing a contract and without the need of a sales person who asks thousand question, but isn't able to answer technical questions. A simple online form should do it. If the process takes to long, developers will go away.
If you do not allow people to really test your product just because they are no paying customers, they will never get paying customers.
