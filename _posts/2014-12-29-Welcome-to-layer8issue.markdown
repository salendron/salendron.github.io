This is a blog about technologie, gadgets, tools, apps, programming, software engineering and about the life of an austrian developer and co-founder of [xamoom.com](http://xamoom.com), [me - Bruno Hautzenberger](http://hautzenberger.at).

## Why in english?
Simple question, simple answer. We live in a connected world, a world in which borders and distance do not really matter when it comes to communication and sharing knowledge. So I decided to blog in english to enable as many people as possible to read what I am writing about.

## Why Jekyll? Why not Wordpress?
I love Wordpress. I think it is one of the best pieces of software ever written (allthough it is written in PHP) and the community arround it is amazing. 
The problem about Wordpress is its biggest strength, it is very powerful and has a lot of features.
I've been using it for years for blogging, but since I do not have that much time to blog, I was looking for something that is a lot simpler and makes it easier for me to write without using a PC. I wanted something fast and simple.
So after testing some alternative systems, I decided to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). 
Jekyll describes itself like this:

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website.

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
